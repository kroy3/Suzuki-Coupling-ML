FIGURE CAPTIONS FOR CHEMRXIV SUBMISSION
========================================

Figure 1. Machine learning model performance benchmarking.
(a) R² comparison with literature showing XGBoost performance relative to YieldBERT 
(Schwaller et al., 2021), YieldGNN (Saebi et al., 2023), and Cronin neural network 
(Steiner et al., 2019). (b) Root mean square error (RMSE) comparison across four 
traditional ML architectures. (c) Predicted vs. actual yields visualization using 
hexbin density plot (n = 1,728 test reactions; R² = 0.903, RMSE = 6.10%). 
(d) Five-fold cross-validation results demonstrating model robustness (error bars 
represent standard deviation across folds).

Figure 2. Comprehensive metal catalyst performance analysis.
(a) Yield distributions across five metal catalysts (Ni, Pd, Ru, Fe, Cu) shown as 
violin plots with embedded box plots. Horizontal dashed line indicates success 
threshold (50% yield). (b) Success rates (percentage of reactions achieving >50% yield) 
with bootstrap 95% confidence intervals (n = 1,000 iterations). Star (★) indicates 
statistically significant difference (p < 0.01). (c) Leaving group compatibility 
heatmap showing mean yields for all metal-leaving group combinations. Red dashed box 
highlights nickel's superior performance with chloride substrates (47% vs. 39% for 
palladium). (d) Cost-performance scatter plot with Pareto frontier (red dashed line). 
Marker size proportional to success rate. Note 467-fold cost advantage of nickel over 
palladium ($75K/kg vs. $35M/kg).

Figure 3. Feature importance analysis with chemical interpretation.
(a) Top 10 features ranked by Random Forest importance using Gini impurity decrease. 
Color gradient from dark (high importance) to light (low importance). Physical 
parameters (reaction time, catalyst loading, temperature, steric hindrance) collectively 
account for 77% of predictive power. Text box highlights physical vs. chemical parameter 
dominance. (b) Temperature-time interaction heatmap showing synergistic effects. 
Data binned into 3×3 grid: temperature (low 60-85°C, medium 85-105°C, high 105-130°C) 
× reaction time (short <8h, medium 8-16h, long >16h). Red dashed box highlights optimal 
conditions (medium temperature + medium time = 52% mean yield). Text annotation indicates 
practical guidance for experimentalists.

Figure 4. XGBoost model diagnostics and validation analysis.
(a) Learning curves showing training set size effect on model performance. Blue line: 
training R² with confidence band (shaded region). Green line: validation R² with 
confidence band. Curves converge at ~4,000 training samples, suggesting adequate data 
for generalization. (b) Predicted vs. actual yields hexbin density plot. Red dashed line 
represents perfect prediction. Statistics box shows final test set performance 
(R² = 0.903, RMSE = 6.10%, MAE = 4.81%, n = 1,728). (c) Residual plot (prediction error 
vs. predicted yield). Horizontal black line at zero represents perfect prediction. 
Red dotted lines indicate ±10% acceptable error threshold. Green shaded region encompasses 
99% of predictions. (d) Error distribution histogram with fitted normal curve 
(black line: μ = 0.2%, σ = 5.9%). Near-normal distribution validates regression assumptions. 
Text box reports skewness and kurtosis metrics.

Figure 5. Representative Suzuki-Miyaura reactions demonstrating substrate diversity.
Five example reactions spanning different catalysts, substrates, and yields: (1) Simple 
aryl bromide with palladium/triphenylphosphine (95% yield), (2) Heteroaryl coupling 
using XPhos ligand (88% yield), (3) Nickel-catalyzed chloride activation with BINAP 
ligand (82% yield), (4) Electron-rich aryl substrate with SPhos ligand (93% yield), 
(5) Iron-catalyzed coupling demonstrating first-row metal feasibility (68% yield). 
Molecular structures rendered with RDKit. Reaction arrows indicate conditions 
(metal/ligand combination). Green boxes show final yields.

Figure 6. Suzuki-Miyaura catalytic cycle mechanism.
Complete catalytic cycle showing four key steps arranged clockwise: (1) Oxidative 
addition (top, blue): Pd(0) reacts with aryl halide (Ar-X) to form Pd(II) complex 
with halide departure (X⁻). (2) Transmetalation (right, orange): Boronic acid 
(Ar'-B(OH)₂) transfers aryl group to palladium, facilitated by base activation, 
generating borate by-product (B(OH)₃). (3) Reductive elimination (bottom, green): 
C-C bond formation between two aryl groups with regeneration of Pd(0) catalyst, 
releasing biaryl product (Ar-Ar'). (4) Pd(0) catalyst regeneration (left, purple): 
Active catalyst ready for next cycle with ligand coordination (Pd(0)L₂). Red dashed 
arrows show substrate inputs and green dashed arrow shows product output. Legend box 
explains arrow types. Key features box lists advantages: mild conditions, broad scope, 
functional group tolerance, water as by-product. Reaction conditions box provides 
typical parameters.

Figure 7. Substrate scope demonstrating functional group tolerance.
Three categories with four examples each: (Left panel) Aryl halides showing leaving 
group reactivity order: bromide (95% yield), iodide (97%), chloride (75%), and triflate 
(OTf, 89%). (Middle panel) Electron-donating and electron-withdrawing functional groups: 
methoxy (93%), amino (87%), methyl (94%), and fluoro (92%). (Right panel) Heteroaromatic 
substrates: pyrimidine (88%), pyridine (90%), furan (78%), and thiophene (85%). Color 
coding: green boxes indicate excellent yields (>85%), yellow boxes indicate good yields 
(75-85%), red boxes indicate moderate yields (<75%). All structures rendered with RDKit 
showing 2D coordinates.
